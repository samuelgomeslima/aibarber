# Security Review - AI Barber Application

## Summary
- **Scope**: Azure Function proxies (`api/chat`, `api/transcribe`), Expo front-end OpenAI integrations, deployment guidance.
- **Date**: 2025-10-08 (UTC)
- **Reviewer**: Automated security assessment by ChatGPT.

## Findings

### 1. Front-end OpenAI API key exposure (resolved)
- **Severity**: High (architectural)
- **Issue**: The Expo client previously used `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY`, which bundled the key into the client and exposed it to end users. Anyone with the app could extract the key and abuse it.
- **Remediation**: Chat and transcription requests now proxy through Azure Functions (`/api/chat` and `/api/transcribe`), which read the `OPENAI_API_KEY` from server-side configuration. The Expo bundle no longer includes the OpenAI secret.

### 2. Anonymous access to chat/transcription proxies (resolved)
- **Severity**: High
- **Issue**: The new proxy endpoints allowed anonymous POSTs, creating an open relay for the server-side OpenAI key.
- **Remediation**: Both proxies now require a shared `OPENAI_PROXY_TOKEN` in the `x-api-key` header and fail fast when the token is missing or incorrect.

## Additional Recommendations
- Implement request logging with caution to avoid storing prompts that may contain sensitive data; prefer structured logging with redaction options.
- Add rate limiting and anomaly detection to the proxy endpoints to prevent abuse.
- Consider automated security testing (SAST/DAST) within CI/CD pipelines to catch regressions.
