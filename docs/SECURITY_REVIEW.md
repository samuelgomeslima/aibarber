# Security Review - AI Barber Application

## Summary
- **Scope**: Azure Function `api/GenerateImage`, Expo front-end OpenAI integrations, deployment guidance.
- **Date**: 2025-10-08 (UTC)
- **Reviewer**: Automated security assessment by ChatGPT.

## Findings

### 1. Missing authentication enforcement on image generation endpoint
- **Severity**: High
- **Issue**: The Azure Function previously accepted requests without verifying an API token when `IMAGE_API_TOKEN` was not configured, allowing unauthenticated use of the OpenAI image endpoint.
- **Remediation**: The function now fails fast when the token is absent and requires clients to supply the matching `x-api-key` (or `x-functions-key`).

### 2. Insufficient input validation for OpenAI image parameters
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Issue**: Client-supplied `size`, `quality`, `response_format`, and arbitrarily long prompts were forwarded directly to OpenAI, risking service abuse and unexpected costs.
- **Remediation**: Added server-side validation to enforce known-safe values and reasonable prompt length limits.

### 3. Front-end OpenAI API key exposure (resolved)
- **Severity**: Closed
- **Issue**: The Expo client previously relied on `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY`, exposing secrets to end users.
- **Remediation**: Chat, transcription, and image requests now flow through Azure Functions (`/api/chat`, `/api/transcribe`, `/api/GenerateImage`) that read the OpenAI key from server-side configuration. No OpenAI secrets are bundled with the client.

## Additional Recommendations
- Implement request logging with caution to avoid storing prompts that may contain sensitive data; prefer structured logging with redaction options.
- Add rate limiting and anomaly detection to the image generation endpoint to prevent abuse.
- Consider automated security testing (SAST/DAST) within CI/CD pipelines to catch regressions.
